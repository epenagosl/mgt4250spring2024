# MGT 4250 Spring 2024 Course Project
Author: Esteban Penagos (epenagos@elon.edu)

## Project description
### Questions of interest
- Which goods are sold the most through E-Commerce?
- What are the countries with the most E-Commerce activity? 
- By having data from 2018 and 2019, did E-Commerce grow in that year and if it did by how much?
### Importance statement 
These questions are important because
1. It will let companies check the amount of goods and services being sold online. 
2. They will also be able to know what products are more likely to be sold online rather than in the store and they would be able to concentrate and do marketing accordingly.  
3. The results could give us a good idea of the potential upcoming year growth.
